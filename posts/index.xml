            <description>&amp;ldquo;Sound&amp;rdquo; as the word &amp;ldquo;music&amp;rdquo; attaches a personal taste, a subjective view, a reason to judge. Throughout my life songs have been able to put me back into a place, a time. I am not alone when I say that I can resort to music during my happiest, darkest or most sombre moments. My love for music has seen me keep vinyl/cassette collections, which turned into CD collections, which moved to iTunes mp3 playlists and now a curated streaming collection.</description>

Throughout my life songs have been able to put me back into a place, a time. I am not alone when I say that I can resort to music during my happiest, darkest or most sombre moments. My love for music has seen me keep vinyl/cassette collections, which turned into CD collections, which moved to iTunes mp3 playlists and now a curated streaming collection. Roll with the times I guess. The playlists I have curated on Spotify are grouped into <a href="#phases">phases</a>
 and <a href="#moods">moods</a>
. It should be pretty self explanatory, but one section is grouped into periods of my life while the other is for a distinct feeling. Curating this list has been an interesting endevaour in that there are songs which I would not call my “favourite” or something I “like”, but can be typical of the period it represents and is not something I will skip these days when it starts playing (differentiating it from songs which remind me of a period but I will still always skip - which are not on my lists). Feel free to listen if you’re interested knowing that each track is special to me in some way - whether evoking a memory or tickling my aural senses to bop my head, dance, grind, headbang, whatever&hellip;</p>

<p>Our family migrated from Fiji to Australia in 1985 when I was 8yo. My pre-teen era is filled with music my father listened to in his 30s, what was on the radio during breakfast before primary school, and the beginnings of acquiring a taste for bands and sounds during my high school years. This period combines the beginnings of my love for metal and hip-hop during my teens after the first time I listened to &ldquo;Number of the Beast&rdquo; and &ldquo;Fear of a Black Planet&rdquo; on vinyl.</p>

<p>While my love for Brit-pop, jangly shoegaze and grunge had started in high school, university life solidified it. This was a time of new friends, new influences, meeting people from different walks of life and subcultures. It also started years of socialising at clubs, all different types, all with different social circles of friends.</p>

 &lt;&ndash; click for Spotify</h4>
<p>More dazed than confused really. These were heady days of outdoor parties, raves in the bush, genre-bending all day festivals and all the trappings they entail. A rennaisance of club culture and a period of electro-rock and synth-pop revival also sprinkled into my consciousness during these fond years.</p>

 &lt;&ndash; click for Spotify</h4>
<p>This is the present. Refining sounds that I like by revisiting bands from yesteryear to either validate first impressions or change my opinion. This is the now, a period of streaming music, recommendations of new music and bands based on collections and listening history.</p>

<p>More a romantic in the <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/New_Romantic" target="_blank">New Romantic</a>
 sense of the word, the idea of falling in love more than being in love itself. This is my collection for that very feeling.</p>

 &lt;&ndash; click for Spotify</h4>
<p>In keeping with the Romantic ideals, this is a set of songs curated for death - whether played at funerals I have attended, or what I would like played at my funeral. Not morbid if you celebrate the idea of life, and some of these songs put me right back into my time with a friend who is no longer with me - as the song happened to be played at their consignment to the grave.</p>

 &lt;&ndash; click for Spotify</h4>
<p>The last 10yrs have seen me travel A LOT. There are no words to describe the feeling when the plane is hovering above Melbourne Airport ready to land and I hear “Solid Rock” or “Great Southern Land”. Patriotism is not about following your country in sporting matches, its about identification of the social and cultural norms in your city or country of choice. Nothing and no-one defines what it is to be Australian to me like this playlist.</p>

<p>For those times when I need to feel like I am once again on a dancefloor, out in the forest and fire twirling.</p>

            <description>The past few months have placed immense demand on remote working and particularly video-conferencing tools. This has placed greater scrutiny on the security practices of companies like Zoom which has received a great deal of press - resulting in better transparency and a commitment to its users for improving its controls.
Putting opinions and conjecture aside for a moment, Zoom&amp;rsquo;s current posture and response got me thinking - in particular, the following aspects were of interest to me:</description>
            <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The past few months have placed immense demand on remote working and particularly video-conferencing tools. This has placed greater scrutiny on the security practices of companies like Zoom which has received a great deal of press - resulting in better <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/facts-around-zoom-encryption-for-meetings-webinars/" target="_blank">transparency</a>
 and a <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/08/update-on-zoom-90-day-plan-to-bolster-key-privacy-and-security-initiatives/" target="_blank">commitment</a>
 to its users for improving its controls.</p>
<p>Putting opinions and conjecture aside for a moment, Zoom&rsquo;s current posture and response got me thinking - in particular, the following aspects were of interest to me:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zoom currently have <a href="https://zoom.us/docs/doc/Zoom-Security-White-Paper.pdf" target="_blank">SOC2, TRUSTe, EU-US Privacy Shield, FedRAMP</a>
 security and privacy certifications</li>
<li>To meet the high capacity demands, Zoom had traffic tunnelled via China.  This can now be controlled by <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/13/coming-april-18-control-your-zoom-data-routing/" target="_blank">explicitly choosing where your traffic should be routed</a>
</li>
<li>In order to meet the <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/01/facts-around-zoom-encryption-for-meetings-webinars/" target="_blank">lack of end-to-encyption</a>
, <a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/alex-stamos-0" target="_blank">Zoom has taken steps to hire  Alex Stamos (ex-CISO for Facebook)</a>
 and has recently <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/05/07/zoom-acquires-keybase-and-announces-goal-of-developing-the-most-broadly-used-enterprise-end-to-end-encryption-offering/" target="_blank">purchased Keybase</a>
.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="compliance">Compliance</h4>
<p>Without going into details around each of the security and privacy certifications, most organisations look for at least SOC2 and FedRAMP from their cloud service providers (various aaS offerings). Some organisations will not only choose these certifications as a baseline upon which to build their own GRC (Governance, Risk and Compliance) checks, but may end up using them as the <em>only</em> validation they do.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do organisations place too much emphasis on compliance to standards without doing their own set of checks?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="data-sovereignty">Data Sovereignty</h4>
<p>The transfer and storage of data is without doubt a key design component when looking into cloud-based services - yet there are also numerous concerns around the supply chain that warrant investigation (when considering both the physical and virtual locations of endpoints):</p>
<ul>
<li>Do we need the same level of transparency and data routing that Zoom is now providing from all our cloud-based providers?</li>
<li>What levels of scrutiny is typically done for supply chains when analysing data transfer and storage? (to belabour the point, Zoom&rsquo;s data was routed through China, <a href="https://blog.zoom.us/wordpress/2020/04/03/response-to-research-from-university-of-torontos-citizen-lab/" target="_blank">deployed on infrastructure provided by an American-owned public cloud provider, located in a data centre owner by an Australian communication service provider</a>
)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="encryption">Encryption</h4>
<p>End-to-end encryption typically makes use of PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) to ensure data in transit and at rest is secure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have we taken stock of all forms of work/personal communication tools to see whether similar practices are followed?  If they don’t, do we move towards safer tools or demand better security from the existing tools?</li>
<li>If end-to-end encryption is not deployed, should we look to ensuring that PFS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) ciphers are used to mitigate being able to store data and decrypt at a future point in time?</li>
</ul>
<p>I don&rsquo;t propose to know the answer to any of these questions, and I am not apologising for any of Zoom&rsquo;s mishaps - I am interested in whether we are placing as much scrutiny across all the software and tools we use in our daily lives (without having to wait for a new article to reactively respond to our security posture).</p>
<p>I will certainly be keeping a close watch on the 90-day plan that Zoom has outlined.  In particular I will look to seeing whether there are practices that they will be undertaking that I need to take into account myself (in terms of choice of software for personal use) as well as in conversations with my customers and partners (when discussing security aspects of their migration to public cloud and cloud-based services).</p>
